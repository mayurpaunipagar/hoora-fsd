three possible reasons for app re rendering
1. improper Use of setState in TextEditingController Listener
2. TextEditingController Rebuilt in build Method
3. Parent Widget Rebuilding Unnecessarily:

----------- how to run flutter app
go inside flutter_eg1 folder

run command -> flutter run

------------ how to test the app

type some test and notice on everykey press the app is not rebuilt

only on submit button it re renders
